IDEAS (Ideas to help make our project into a functioning game.)
1) Use google cloud Vision API to detect the person in the image.
	Apple may have something similar to this.
2) Andriod app to have people start games/moderate games.
3) Push notifications in order to communicate kills.
4) Request access of camera so only pictures taken through the app will count.
5) Request contact access to start games with your friends. 
	Google play can work too.
